# Dennis-Mack-Python-Portfolio
This is my Python Data Science Portfolio. In today's data-driven world, the ability to analyze, visualize and interpret complex data sets is a highly sought-after skillset. As a data scientist, I work with Python to create various data analysis and visualization projects, some of which I have compiled in this portfolio. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, as well as a deep learning project using Tensorflow to create an Artificial Neural Network, demonstrating my ability to apply statistical and machine learning techniques to real-world problems. Whether you are a hiring manager, a fellow data scientist, , or just someone who is interested in data science, I hope that this portfolio will provide you with insights into my data science journey and showcase my capabilities.
# Technologies
The entire portfolio is written in Python. The list of libraries used:
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - Tensorflow
  - Keras
  - Scikit-learn
# Models Trained
The list of ML models trained in the portfoilio:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - K Means
  - K Nearest Neighbors
  - Supoort Vector Machines
  - Natural Language Processing
  - Decision Trees and Random Forests
  
  The biggest project in the portfolio is a Deep Learning Model using Tensorflow to create an Artificial Neural Network 
# Launch
To Run these analyses yourself just download the repository to your computer as you would any other. The datset files for each of the projects are in a data folder in the repository called "Data" and they are referenced as such relative to their postition to their respective data projects. Keep this in mind if you are not working in your "Downloads" folder when running them
# Model Descriptions
## Linear Regression
Using Data from an Ecommerce store based in New York City, I was tasked with finding whether the company should spend their resources on the website or on their mobile app. I trained a Linear Regression Model to Regress a customers yearly amount spent with various features of their interactions with the company
## Logistic Regression 
### Advertising Model
Using Advertising Data from an an agency, I created a Logistic Regression model to predict whether or not an internet user clicked on a given ad based on the features of that user
### NFL Model
Using data from every team for every game of the entire 2021 NFL season, I created a Logistic Regression Model to predict whether or not a team will win a particular game based on certain statistics from that game
