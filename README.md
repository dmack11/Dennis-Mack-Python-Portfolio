# Dennis-Mack-Python-Portfolio
This is my Python Data Science Portfolio. In today's data-driven world, the ability to analyze, visualize and interpret complex data sets is a highly sought-after skillset. As a data scientist, I work with Python to create various data analysis and visualization projects, some of which I have compiled in this portfolio. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, as well as a deep learning project using Tensorflow to create an Artificial Neural Network, demonstrating my ability to apply statistical and machine learning techniques to real-world problems. Whether you are a hiring manager, a fellow data scientist, , or just someone who is interested in data science, I hope that this portfolio will provide you with insights into my data science journey and showcase my capabilities.
# Technologies
The entire portfolio is written in Python. The list of libraries used:
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - Tensorflow
  - Keras
  - Scikit-learn
# Models Trained
The biggest project in the portfolio is a Deep Learning Model using Tensorflow to create an Artificial Neural Network

The list of the rest of ML models trained in the portfoilio:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression

# Launch
To Run these analyses yourself just download the repository to your computer as you would any other. The datset files for each of the projects are in a data folder in the repository called "Data" and they are referenced as such relative to their postition to their respective data projects. Keep this in mind if you are not working in your "Downloads" folder when running them
# Model Descriptions
## Tensorflow Models
Using a LendingClub.com dataset from Kaggle.com, I used historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted or not, and created a model that predicts whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan
## Natural Language Processing 
Using Yelp Review data from Kaggle.com, I created a model that classified Yelp Reviews as either 1-Star or 5-star based on the text content in the reviews.

## Supervised Models
### Linear Regression
Using Data from an Ecommerce store based in New York City, I was tasked with finding whether the company should spend their resources on the website or on their mobile app. I trained a Linear Regression Model to Regress a customers yearly amount spent with various features of their interactions with the company
### Logistic Regression 
#### Advertising Model
Using Advertising Data from an agency, I created a Logistic Regression model to predict whether or not an internet user clicked on a given ad based on the features of that user
#### NFL Model
Using data from every team for every game of the entire 2021 NFL season, I created a Logistic Regression Model to predict whether or not a team will win a particular game based on certain statistics from that game.
### Random Forest
Using publicly available data from Lendingclub.com, I played the role of an investor looking to find people with a high probability of paying me back. My goal was to create a model to predict this. Training on ceratin features of the borrowers and the characteristics of the loans themselves I created a random forest to predict whether someone meets the criteria for a given loan
### Support Vector Machine
Using the famous Iris data set built into Seaborn, I created a multivariate classification model that distinguishes flower types based on certain features
### K Nearest Neighbors
Here I was given an artificail data set and given a target class from one of the columns and used KNN to create a binary classification model based on the rest of the features.
## Unsupervised Models
### K Means
Using Data from over 700 Universities, I used K Means Clustering to create a binary classification model to predict whether a Univerity was public or private.  While the dataset itself does have the labels of the univeristy they were not used when creating the model in order to keep it unsupervised
